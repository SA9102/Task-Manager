# Task Manager

A simple app for quickly and efficiently organising and keeping track of your tasks.

## Info

My first Svelte/SvelteKit project. Though I'm continuing to learn React, Svelte caught my eye after hearing many positive things about it, such as having a compiler which allows it to run fast, and also having features built into SvelteKit such as routing and stores. So I decided to try it out and make a project.

This project is made with TypeScript.
